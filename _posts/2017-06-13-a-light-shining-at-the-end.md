We finally had the appointment with UNICAMP's Dr. Marcondes. He's a young neurologist, but a renowned specialist in motion and motor related problems. After some hours looking at all the exams that Enzo did, talking with us and performing some direct examinations, he said that he suspects of either two possibilities. The first one (very remote) would be a congenital degenerative disease, but he was almost sure that this wasn't the case, as Enzo's twin, who is homozygous didn't show any symptoms of such disease. The other option, which is much more likely to be the cause, would be an auto-immune encephalitis. He asked for a set of exams to diagnose and detect it.

The only problem is that this exam set seems to be performed by only a single lab in the world (located in Barcelona, Spain), due to the method's patent restrictions. As a side effect, the results will take around 30 days to became available...

So, although there is some new light shed on this, we now will have to deal with the anxiety to get this answer.
