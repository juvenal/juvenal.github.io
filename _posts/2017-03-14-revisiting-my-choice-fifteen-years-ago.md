Yesterday I was notified that IBM no longer required my work as a Software Engineer at Brazil's Linux Technology Center (LTC), as well as 25 other really brilliant engineers and colleagues. Just moments earlier, I got news informing that China's LTC was shutdown completely on Friday's previous week. I'm not yet sure about the reasons for all these massive layoffs and the disposal of so many talented people.
