I was invited by Rodolfo Jardim de Azevedo, my friend, teacher and researcher at UNICAMP Computing Institute to give a talk about git there.<!--more-->

I decided to use a lecture that I did some time ago to the IBM Linux Technology Center audience, in our internal technical exchange learning sessions.

You can see this lecture at Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzjnFcIcswc), but I added it below for your convenience.
