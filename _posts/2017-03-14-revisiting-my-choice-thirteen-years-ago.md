Yesterday I was notified that IBM no longer required my work as a Software Engineer at Brazil's Linux Technology Center (LTC), as well as 25 other really brilliant engineers and colleagues.<!--more-->
Just moments earlier, at our morning coffee at the office, I got news informing that China's LTC was shutdown completely on Friday's previous week. I'm not yet sure about the reasons for all these massive layoffs and the disposal of so many talented people, but one thing I'm sure about. The decision that I took 13 years ago, remain as fresh as if it was took today.
