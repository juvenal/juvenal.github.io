One thing that aways bored me with GitHub when using the terminal was the lack of a CLI utility to interact with it. You aways have to open a browser, head to the GitHub page and perform the action that you need to.<!--more-->

That's the main reason behind this small project. To provide a command line tool that directly interacts with the GitHub REST API to provide services directly on the command line.
